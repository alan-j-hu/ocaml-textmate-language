# ocaml-textmate-language

This library provides functions for reading TextMate grammars and parsing
lines of source code.

Note that this library uses the PCRE regex engine, while [TextMate uses
Oniguruma regex](https://macromates.com/manual/en/regular_expressions).

Read the documentation at https://dosaylazy.github.io/ocaml-textmate-language/.

`textmate-language` follows SemVer. It is currently in 0.Y.z, so Y will be
incremented for breaking changes.
